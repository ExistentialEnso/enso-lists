# macOS Apps

My preferred lapto/desktop OS is macOS. Simply put, it provides the best user experience while still offering enough under-the-hood customizability. And in an era when more is done in virtual machines and containers, it makes a good host OS.

## Communication

* [Caprine](https://sindresorhus.com/caprine/) - Best desktop Facebook Messenger client I've used.
* [Flume](https://flumeapp.com) - Fairly minimalist Instagram client that is an absolute joy to use.
* [Signal](https://signal.org/download/) - Popular chat app with encrypted messages.
* [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) - My favorite email client for macOS. Also, its logo is a lot better than Mail.app's which is a relic of Apple's skeumorphic years.
* [Twitteriffic](https://twitterrific.com/mac) - Twitter weakened aspects of its API, making 3rd party apps less powerful, but this is the best option for macOS. Integration with the share menu is a nice plus.

## Productivity

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - Spotlight, but even better. With the Powerpack, you can install workflows that make Alfred a versatile tool that can offer an easy command line-esque interface while still providing graphical, real-time feedback.
* [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) - Though I have a substantial social media presence, if I get too caught up in the goings-on there, I can spend hours that later feel wasted scrolling through things. Focus lets you temporarily block websites and apps that distract you.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) - Admittedly somewhat pricey, but this is the best way I've found to track what I need to get done.
* [Noizio](http://noiz.io) - Ambient sound player. I like to mix "Summer Night" and "October Rain" to relax and focus.
* [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) - How I browse my news feeds (using Feedly, but it supports others!)
* [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) - Great tool for keeping track of your writing and getting a distraction-free workspace.
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) - Academic research organization tool that I used to track peer reviewed research.

## Entertainment

* [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/) - The app that made me finally ditch VLC. The user experience feels so much more Mac-y.
* [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org) - A ROM/ISO library manager library that has built-in emulators for a lot of older consoles.

## Developer

* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - API documentation browser.
* [Expressions](https://www.apptorium.com/expressions) - Handy tool I use for testing and debugging RegEx expressions.
* [Medis](http://getmedis.com) - Well-designed tool for managing the key/value pairs in a Redis store.
* [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org) - Though the more feature-rich Studio 3T might appeal more to some, I love that Robo 3T is a cleanly designed, to-the-point way to work with Mongo databases.
* [SnippetsLab](https://snippetslab.org) - Great for little bits of code that might be useful in other contexts and projects.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Yeah, yeah, it's a Microsoft product, but this is my favorite lightweight coding editor.

## Utilities

* [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Enables me to keep all my passwords in sync and unique, even on browsers/devices without Apple Keychain support.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com) - Organize your menu bar icons.
* [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app) - User styles add-on for Safari.
* [Paste](https://pasteapp.me) - Clipboard history and cloud syncing between devices.
* [SwiftDefaultApps](https://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps/releases) - Lets you manage what opens what.
* [Typeface](https://typefaceapp.com) - A better alternative to the built-in font book on macOS.
* [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wipr/id1320666476?mt=12) - Ad/malware blocker for Safari that makes the browser a lot snappier to boot.

## Command Line

* [Brew](https://brew.sh) - The easiest way to install stuff through the command line.
* [Hyper](https://hyper.is) - Sleeker Terminal with support for skinning and plugins.
* [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Install and switch between Node versions from the command line.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - Does a better job of npm dependency management than npm's own CLI tool.
